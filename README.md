## Purpose:
It is not an easy task to build a website that has robust functionality that will impress visitors. The client in this scenario was looking to build an interactive website using JavaScript that could display information in a table format. In addition to displaying the data the website would allow visitors to filter the results by different variables such as city, state, date, and shape. The techniques utilized in this analysis should be able to retrieve different results based on the dataset available. 
## Results:

Above is the result of JavaScript coding that enables visitors to filter the data that they are looking for on the website.

The above image shows that the table can have multiple columns that pulls in the data that is housed within the array. To retrieve this information it is necessary to filter based on the listed criteria (date, city, state, etc.)

## Summary:

One drawback of this webpage is that it does not display an enter button that allows visitors to know that they are performing the search. The functionality needs to be written within the code to produce this button. 
In addition to an enter button that can be clicked by visitors to the site there should also be images that go along with the data tables. It is okay to look at the data in written form but incorporating images could make the website more interactive. Also the images could be clickable and take the visitor to an information page about the event. Overall JavaScript is a great tool for creating a website that is both interactive and provides a wealth of information.
